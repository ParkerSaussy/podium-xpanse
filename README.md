# Xpanse Take-Home Coding Test: Front-End Application with React and TypeScript

Implemented by Parker Saussy as an interview task.

## Cloning & Setup
The repository should be public - please contact me if this appears to not be the case.

To clone (without SSH, which I almost exclusively use), copy/paste the following into a terminal while located in the directory wherein you'd like the app to live.

```git clone https://github.com/ParkerSaussy/podium-xpanse.git```

Once the app is cloned, navigate to the root directory and type:

```npm i```

To install all relevant packages. No other setup should be required.

## Running & Basic Usage
To run the app, type:

```npm run start``` 

...from the root directory.

By default, the app should run on localhost at port 3000.
